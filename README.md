# Craft-Qt5 

Fork of KDE's Craft for MY personal use. I am not a programmer, I just want Qt5 KolourPaint for Windows. 

## Changes: 

- Renamed branch "master" to "master-qt6". 
- Renamed branch "qt5-lts" to "master". 

## In-Progress Changes: 
- Changing any links that lead to KF6 to links that lead to KF5. 
- Changing any links that lead to Qt6 to links that lead to Qt5. 
- Fork repositories and rename branches of said repositories when necessary to change KF6 and Qt6 links to KF5 and Qt6 Links.
